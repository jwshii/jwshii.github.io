## About / [Research](https://jwshi21.github.io/research.html) / [Teaching](https://jwshi21.github.io/teaching.html)

I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. My advisor is Benjamin Pierce. I am a member of the programming languages [group](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/).

Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree at MIT, where I double majored in mathematics and computer science. I benefited greatly from the undergraduate research program, including and especially as part of Saman Amarasinghe's compilers [group](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/commit/).

I can be reached at <jwshi@seas.upenn.edu>.
