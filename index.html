    <h1>Jessica Shi</h1>
    <p>
        I am a second-year PhD student in computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. My advisor is Benjamin
        Pierce. I am a member of the programming languages <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/">group</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previously, I completed my bachelor's degree at MIT, where I double majored in mathematics and computer
        science. I benefited greatly from the undergraduate research program, including and especially as part of
        Saman Amarasinghe's compilers <a href="https://groups.csail.mit.edu/commit/">group</a>.
