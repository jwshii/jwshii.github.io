I am broadly interested in how to increase the effectiveness and usability of tools that increase the correctness and clarity of code. For example, how can we make it easier to read the proofs written in proof assistants? Our early ideas are presented below:

Presented at PLATEAU in February 2023.

I am currently also working on a property-based testing project. Details TK.

I worked on projects related to the [tensor algebra compiler](https://tensor-compiler.org/) as an undergraduate student. My attempt to leverage symmetry is summarized [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00186).
